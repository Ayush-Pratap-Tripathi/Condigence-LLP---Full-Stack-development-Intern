## ðŸ“˜ Project Details

### 1. AILearn (E-Learning Platform with AI Tutor)
**Problem:** Traditional e-learning platforms lack interactive guidance and personalized support.  
**Solution:** A web-based Learning Management System (LMS) with an **AI Tutor chatbot** that explains uploaded notes, answers queries, and provides contextual learning assistance.  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Course & user management, REST APIs)  
- **Frontend:** React (Course browsing, AI chatbot interface)  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **AI Tutor:** GPT-based chatbot referencing uploaded notes  

**Outcome:**  
- Interactive and personalized learning experience.  
- Digital management for instructors to share notes and monitor progress.  
- Scalable design for future features (voice-enabled tutors, adaptive learning paths).
